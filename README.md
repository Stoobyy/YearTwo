Put 'em on the news or somethin'
I'm evil like Luci' son
A whole lotta bitches be hatin' on me 'cause I got all the bunnies
Had to fall back with my last bitch 'cause she was just playin' with my lil' time
I'm travelin' the world like the pope, bringin' the praise right to my son
Shawty, you gotta be canceled, you make me feel some type way
And no, I can't be canceled 'cause you feel some type way, uh, uh
I'm in the lane, andale, andale, andale
Uh, I'ma keep killin' these hoes, I'm fuckin' on my main
Pink in my cup like a brain, sippin' on zombie
Bust the ho, do my braids, then I go hungry
I'm cookin' up like Montay, bitches on me (DJ Montay)
I told her, "The glove don't fit, " I'm feelin' like O.J
The racks in my pocket and I link with OJ
Ooh, .24s in the socket, got me feelin' like Kobe, R.I.P., uh
All my boys, they strapped up, don't try shit
Welcome to the party, bitch, we all narcissists
Haha, oh, you like that? Yeah (free ZayGuap)
Uh, oh, you like that? Yeah, yeah
(Oh, you like that?) Oh
